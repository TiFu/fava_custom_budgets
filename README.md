# Features to be added

* For inc_exp_budgets force budget for *all* open accounts for a given year
* For inc_exp_budgets force proper hierarchy (e.g. sum up if only Inc:Work:Salary and Inc:Work:Budget is defined) --> assume implicit "0" budget for parents


* Optimize webpack config to get rid of a lot of the useless shit lol
