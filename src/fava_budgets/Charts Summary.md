Which charts do I want for the budget overview?

(A) YtD budget adherence (i.e. bar chart for each month with income, expenses vs plan)

(B) Last 3 months comparison -> income vs budget, expenses vs budget

LEt's see what I actually need

MVP:

**Annual Budget Summary YTD**

* YTD report
    * YTD for this year as This month - 1 ->  so only after budget closure

    * Make table rows clickable -> selected row is shown as deep dive over last few months!; default selected: Income/Expenses
        -> even in Annual comparison for easy deep dive...

* Monthly report 
    -> Deep dive into categories (e.g. on N-2 / N-3 level show break-down...)


* MTD -> 1 separate tab

* BudgetComparison
    * 3 columns: Income, Expenses (total)
    Account
        Budgets YTD
        Actuals YTD
        Diff (%)

    Has breakdown by account Income/expenses with Account Budget Actual [Diff (%)]
        -> Chart: Could be a column chart with "Budget & Actual"    
            ======>     |

**Monthly budget Summary**

Additional features:
    * Coloring of bars according to budget status (e.g. green / orange  /red)
    * Filtering of accoutns in overview -> no budget, no income/expense -> don't show
    * Add profits overview
    * Make tables expandable/closable based on level... maybe!
